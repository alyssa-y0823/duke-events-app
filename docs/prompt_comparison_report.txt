Prompt Engineering Experiment Report

GOAL: evaluate the effectiveness of different prompt construction strategies for generating user profile embeddings in the event recommendation system.

METHODOLOGY: tested three strategies for constructing the query string passed to the embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for a "Computer Science Student" profile.

Strategy 1 (Tag-based)
   Query: "Computer Science coding hackathon technology artificial intelligence"
   Theory: Maximizes keyword density for cosine similarity.

Results:
- Rank 1: AI Health Data Science (0.40)
- Rank 2: The False and its Falsifiers (0.23)
Assessment: High first score but big drop-off. Rank 2 is irrelevant (arts event).

Strategy 2 (Natural Language)
   Query: "I am a Junior Computer Science student interested in coding, hackathons, technology, and artificial intelligence."
   Theory: Provides semantic sentence structure closer to training data of sentence-transformers.

Results:
- Rank 1: AI Health Data Science (0.35)
- Rank 2: Researcher Fundamentals (0.32)
Assessment: More stable. Scores slightly lower but consistent across top results.

Strategy 3 (Role-Playing)
   Query: "Target Persona: Computer Science Student. Key Interests: coding, hackathon, technology, artificial intelligence. Context: Academic and social events."
   Theory: Uses structured metadata keys to separate identity from interests, handling polysemy better.

Results:
- Rank 1: Researcher Fundamentals (0.37)
- Rank 2: AI Health Data Science (0.37)
Assessment: Best performance. High, consistent scores and multiple relevant events retrieved confidently.

ANALYSIS
- Tag-based approach is brittle. It latches onto exact matches (e.g., "AI") strongly but fails when exact keywords are missing, leading to noise filling the top slots.
- Natural Language approach is safer but dilutes the keywords with stop words ("I am a...", "interested in"), slightly lowering the similarity scores for the top matches.
- Role-Playing approach offered the best balance - explicitly defines the "Target Persona" and "Key Interests", maintaining high relevance scores for multiple items without drifting into noise.

CONCLUSION: adopt the Role-Playing prompt structure for the production implementation of the `scorer.py` / ranking service.
